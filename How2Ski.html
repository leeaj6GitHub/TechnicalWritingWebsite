        <h1>How to Ski</h1>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Stand upright.</strong> Position yourself with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees
                slightly bent, keeping your weight slightly forward over the middle of your skis.</li>
            <li><strong>Hold your ski poles.</strong> Grip your ski poles firmly with your hands, placing the straps
                around your wrists to prevent dropping them.</li>
            <li><strong>Start sliding.</strong> Push off gently with your poles or use a slight downhill slope to begin
                moving forward, maintaining your balance as you glide.</li>
            <li><strong>Stop safely. </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>To stop, gradually apply pressure to the inside edges of both skis by shifting your weight
                        backward slightly and bringing the tips closer together until you form a wedge.</li>
                    <li>Hold this position to stop, or move on to step 5 to begin turning.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Practice turning. </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>To turn left, shift your weight slightly onto your right ski while pushing the edge of your left
                        ski into the snow, guiding yourself in the desired direction.</li>
                    <li>To turn right, reverse this process by shifting your weight onto your left ski and pushing the
                        edge of your right ski into the snow.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Control your speed.</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Control your speed by adjusting the angle of your skis in the wedge and using your poles for
                        balance and stability.</li>
                    <li>Turning more frequently will cause you to go slower, while turning less frequently will make you
                        go faster.</li>
                    <li>Making “S” shapes in the snow with your turning will help to keep you from going too fast.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Practice falling.</strong> If you lose your balance and fall, try to relax and roll onto your
                side to minimize impact. Use your poles to push yourself up and resume skiing.</li>
            <li><strong>Practice, practice, practice.</strong> Continue practicing basic techniques such as turning,
                stopping, and controlling your speed until you feel comfortable and confident on your skis.</li>
