        <ol>
            <li><strong>Find a flat, stable surface.</strong> Look for an area with enough space to maneuver should you start sliding and put on your skis, away from crowded or slippery areas.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Stand with your skis parallel.</strong> Place your skis side by side on the ground, with the bindings facing upward and the tips pointing forward.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Step into the bindings.</strong> Position one foot at a time into the bindings, aligning the toe of your boot with the front of the binding and ensuring that the heel of your boot is centered over the heel piece.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Engage the bindings.</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Use your ski poles to stabilize yourself.</li>
                <li>Push down on the heel piece of the binding, securing your boot in place.</li>
                <li>If you hear a click and the clamp mechanism is angled up, your binding is engaged properly.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Test the bindings.</strong> Gently lift your ski boot off the ground to ensure that it is securely fastened in the binding and won't release prematurely. If your ski is sliding around on your foot or came out when you picked your foot up, talk to the rental area at the resort about further adjustments to your bindings.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Repeat for the other ski.</strong> Step into the bindings of the other ski using the same process, making sure both skis are securely attached to your boots before moving.</li>
