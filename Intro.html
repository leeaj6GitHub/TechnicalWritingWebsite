        <h2>What is this guide for?</h2>
        <p>This guide aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to skiing for total beginners. It covers everything

            you're planning your first ski trip or just curious about the sport, this guide is designed to help you get
            started with your confidence.</p>
        <h2>Who is this guide for?</h2>
        <p>This guide is for anyone who is completely new to skiing and wants to learn the basics from scratch. Whether
            you're a total beginner who has never set foot on the slopes or someone who has tried skiing a few times but
            still feels like a novice, this guide is here to help you gain the skills you need to enjoy skiing safely
            and with fun.</p>
        <h2>How do you use it?</h2>
        <p>Simply start at the beginning and work your way through each section. Each part builds on the previous one,
            so it's best to go through them in order. If you're new to skiing, you might want to read through the entire
            guide first to get an overview. Then, come back to the sections that interest you the most or that you feel
            you need to focus on.</p>
