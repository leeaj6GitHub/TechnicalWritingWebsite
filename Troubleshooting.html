        <h1>How to Ski</h1>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Stand upright. Position yourself with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent, keeping your weight slightly forward over the middle of your skis.</li>
            <li>Hold your ski poles. Grip your ski poles firmly with your hands, placing the straps around your wrists to prevent dropping them.</li>
            <li>Start sliding. Push off gently with your poles or use a slight downhill slope to begin moving forward, maintaining your balance as you glide.</li>
            <li>Stop safely. 
                <ul>
                    <li>To stop, gradually apply pressure to the inside edges of both skis by shifting your weight backward slightly and bringing the tips closer together until you form a wedge.</li>
                    <li>Hold this position to stop, or move on to step 5 to begin turning.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Practice turning. 
                <ul>
                    <li>To turn left, shift your weight slightly onto your right ski while pushing the edge of your left ski into the snow, guiding yourself in the desired direction.</li>
                    <li>To turn right, reverse this process by shifting your weight onto your left ski and pushing the edge of your right ski into the snow.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Control your speed. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Control your speed by adjusting the angle of your skis in the wedge and using your poles for balance and stability.</li>
                    <li>Turning more frequently will cause you to go slower, while turning less frequently will make you go faster.</li>
                    <li>Making “S” shapes in the snow with your turning will help to keep you from going too fast.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Practice falling. If you lose your balance and fall, try to relax and roll onto your side to minimize impact. Use your poles to push yourself up and resume skiing.</li>
            <li>Practice, practice, practice. Continue practicing basic techniques such as turning, stopping, and controlling your speed until you feel comfortable and confident on your skis.</li>
