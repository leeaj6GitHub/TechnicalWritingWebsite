        <h1>Brief History of Skiing</h1>

        <h2>Prehistoric Skiing</h2>
        <li>Skiing originated during the last Ice Age, with cave drawings suggesting it was used for movement.</li>
        <li>The Sami people are credited with being the first skiers. They primarily skied for hunting and
            transportation.</li>
        <li>The earliest skis, dating back to 8000 years BC, were found in Northern China and were made of wood covered
            in horsehair.</li>

        <h2>Modern Skiing</h2>
        <li>Alpine (downhill) skiing evolved in the 18th century from military competitions in Norway involving skiing
            and shooting.</li>
        <li>Olaf Rye became the first known ski jumper in 1809.</li>
        <li>Ski design progressed in the 1800s with the invention of the Cambered Ski and the Telemark Ski, which
            allowed for carving turns.</li>
        <li>The steel edge ski was invented in 1928, improving grip and enabling downhill turns.</li>
        <li>Hannes Schneider developed the stem christie turn and parallel turn in the 1920s, revolutionizing skiing
            techniques.</li>
        <li>Skiing became popular worldwide by the 1930s, with Hannes Schneider introducing skiing to Japan.</li>
        <li>Downhill skiing was first included in the Winter Olympics in 1936.</li>
        <li>The invention of the chair lift in 1936 revolutionized skiing as a recreational activity, allowing multiple
            downhill runs without the need to climb back up the hill.</li>
        <li>Freestyle skiing was recognized as a sport in 1979 and debuted at the 1988 Winter Olympics.</li>
        <li>Twin-tipped skis were perfected in the mid-nineties, leading to the development of snow parks in ski
            resorts.</li>
        <li>Ski resorts have evolved to offer a range of amenities and activities beyond skiing, attracting visitors
            from around the world.</li>
