        <h1>Brief History of Skiing</h1>
        
        <h2>Prehistoric Skiing</h2>
        <p>Skiing originated during the last Ice Age, with cave drawings suggesting it was used for movement.</p>
        <p>The Sami people are credited with being the first skiers. They primarily skied for hunting and transportation.</p>
        <p>The earliest skis, dating back to 8000 years BC, were found in Northern China and were made of wood covered in horsehair.</p>
        
        <h2>Modern Skiing</h2>
        <p>Alpine (downhill) skiing evolved in the 18th century from military competitions in Norway involving skiing and shooting.</p>
        <p>Olaf Rye became the first known ski jumper in 1809.</p>
        <p>Ski design progressed in the 1800s with the invention of the Cambered Ski and the Telemark Ski, which allowed for carving turns.</p>
        <p>The steel edge ski was invented in 1928, improving grip and enabling downhill turns.</p>
        <p>Hannes Schneider developed the stem christie turn and parallel turn in the 1920s, revolutionizing skiing techniques.</p>
        <p>Skiing became popular worldwide by the 1930s, with Hannes Schneider introducing skiing to Japan.</p>
        <p>Downhill skiing was first included in the Winter Olympics in 1936.</p>
        <p>The invention of the chair lift in 1936 revolutionized skiing as a recreational activity, allowing multiple downhill runs without the need to climb back up the hill.</p>
        <p>Freestyle skiing was recognized as a sport in 1979 and debuted at the 1988 Winter Olympics.</p>
        <p>Twin-tipped skis were perfected in the mid-nineties, leading to the development of snow parks in ski resorts.</p>
        <p>Ski resorts have evolved to offer a range of amenities and activities beyond skiing, attracting visitors from around the world.</p>
